# Overview

This project is a Restaurant Directory app written in JavaScript using React Native and Expo. It’s designed both as a practical, playable mobile app and as a learning exercise to practice mobile development concepts such as navigation, event handling, list rendering, component reuse, asset fallbacks, simple data logic, and saving persistent state (favorites).

The Restaurant Directory App is a React Native-based mobile application built with Expo.
In the app, users browse a list of restaurants with images, cuisine, location, and ratings, then open a detail view to explore menu items with prices and descriptions. The goal is to collect and present useful restaurant information cleanly and intuitively, while keeping performance smooth across devices.

The goal is to provide a compact but featureful React Native project you can extend (add search, filters, maps, backend APIs, admin tools, favorites, etc.) while keeping the code readable and educational.
